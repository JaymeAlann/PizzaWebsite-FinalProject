# PizzaWebsite-FinalProject
This was a project for my Software Engineering class where were tasked with designing a pizza order and delivery system for a new pizza shop. This shop would be a small start-up with carryout and delivery only. Requirements for this project were summarized as the following,"You are to design the whole computer system that will set up new customers, take orders, calculate bills, process payments, and contain the restaurant menu."

The Specification and Detailed information was as follows:

1. You will set up a record for each new customer. This information will be keyed by customer phone number. Put information into the master record such as name, address, phone and type of charge account (Visa/ MasterCard). You also need to record pertinent information for locating the address (i.e., subdivision name, closest major intersection, etc.)
2. Your system needs to process payments in the form of checks, cash or credit cards. You will need to keep track of the type of payment made and the amount.
3. Users will access the customer database for all customer transactions. The information should come up for already established customers showing their address and delivery information.
4. Your system should be able to print out a receipt of the order with a place to sign the form by the customer if it is on a credit card. This should have customer information, a list of items ordered, if it is for delivery or pickup, and amount due.
5. Your system should contain the complete restaurant menu for order-taking purposes. The user needs to have GUI access to the various menu items and be able to quickly enter the desired orders. This menu needs to have various sizes of pizzas, the typical types of toppings, various crust options, and beverages. The customer should be able to order things like a medium, thin crust pizza, with pepperoni and extra cheese."

This project was insanly fun to work on and I will continue to push updates and improvements to the site especially since this project was limited on time and although I recieved high marks for a grade, I would like to make this fully functionaly webpage with all the bells and whistles. 

If you are a student or trying to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL databse systems then feel free to give this code a try and mess around with it. I learned a lot throughout this process and hope to continue to learn more as I progress.
